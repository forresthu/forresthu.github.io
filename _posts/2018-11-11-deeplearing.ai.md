## Linear model

### Lost function
* SVM (hinge loss)
* Cross-entropy loss function(softmax) 

You can use an inline formula $$\forall x \in R$$ like this one 
Or centered formula like  
$$
M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ldots \\
\end{array} \right)
$$

```python
this is a code block
```

### Optimization
